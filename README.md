Python library for Symbolic Computation &amp; Pedagogy

A simple, expandable Python library for symbolic math, designed to help developers build educational tools with step-by-step solutions. The library supports multilingual output for descriptive steps, and intend to cover a wide range of topics, making it ideal for creating math related educational apps.

This is created as the protoype model for the core of "Mathematishia Computer Algebra System", but feel free to use this package as the way you wanted, licensed under the MIT license.

<!--
TODO ::
create more expressions to handle test cases,
add the step support to the basic operations
add language feature

re-write the entire subtraction class from scratch, don't rely ln addition class .

definealty re-write the entire subtraction class from scratch, this time no trying to copy addition and reversing it :))
Considerations -> Do we really need BinaryOperator and UnaryOperator ? instead try to get ideas from sympy or mathjs and mathsteps

## TO COSNIDER:
when doing all the evaluation and calculations isntead of using int, float consider
to stick with Number class instead or explicitly use Integer or Float class from the 
package itself so modification will be easier to handle since every component in here
are custom builds
